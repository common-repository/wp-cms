== Description ==

WP-CMS is a plugin for Wordpress that changes the functionality of the Wordpress admin backend to act more like a CMS. 
The blog functionality becomes optional and the focus is on writing pages to make Wordpress as user friendly for 
you and your clients as possible.

== Installation ==

After you've downloaded and extracted the files:

1. Upload the complete 'wp-cms' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You're done. Wordpress is now a CMS.

You can access the WP-CMS settings via the "settings" menu to toggle blog functionality.

= Uninstalling =

To uninstall WP-CMS:

1. Delete the "home" page with the content "thanks for using wp-cms" (if it was created).
2. Go to "Settings > Reading" and change these options back to whatever you like. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if I have Wordpress v2.6 or below? =

You can use the previous version of this plugin (v1.2.1) with the older style Wordpress UI (ie. pre Wordpress 2.7).

= But I can still access posts and other blog functionality if I manually type in the url =

Yes this plugin does NOT restrict access to any part of the Wordpress backend. It just hides elements from users
to make the backend simpler.
